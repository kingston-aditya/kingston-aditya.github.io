I am a second-year Ph.D. student working in Computer Vision at [UMD UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Ang Li](https://www.ang-li.com/). My research interests are currently in exploring video world models. 

I like to wonder about the following two questions -
1. To what extent does a lack of what factor of temporal complexity inhibit the ability of VideoLLMs to form coherent global spatial representations? 
2. Can diffusion-based paradigms outperform autoregressive models in temporal reasoning by leveraging more effective conditional propagation during the latent denoising process?

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/), where I was advised by Prof. [Sreelakshmi Manjunath](https://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~sreelakshmi/) and received the [President of India Gold Medal](https://academics.iitmandi.ac.in/convocations/11thconvocation) and [Institute Silver Medal](https://academics.iitmandi.ac.in/convocations/11thconvocation).
